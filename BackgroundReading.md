## Background Reading and Information ##

1. Early work on the Environmental Data Retrieval API was done by the Met Ocean Domain Working Group, who used the name Weather on the Web (WotW). They have drafted an Engineering Rport to summarise the experiences and recommendations. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER 

2. The Met Ocean Domain Working Group will produce an OGC Best Practice document to give guidance to implementers of services in a meteorological context. This will be in a new OGC GitHub repository.

3. There are some simple use cases or scenarios at https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/tree/master/use-cases 

4. There is some more background material in the Weather on the Web repo at https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web . The README.md file is a good place to start. Some fo the challenges are at https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER/blob/master/7-challenges.adoc

5. The minutes of this group should highlight the decisions that have been made. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/Environmental-Data-Retrieval-API/wiki 

6. The background for an API, rather than protocol, serialisation or data format, approach is at https://docs.opengeospatial.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html and the blog entry at https://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2996 

7. The API work across OGC is strongly informed by the W3C Recommmendation: Data on the Web Best Practices https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/ and the W3C Candidate Recommendation and Technical Note: Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/, jointly developed by OGC and W3C.

8. OGC's current Best Practice for developing APIs is at https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-Web-API-Guidelines 

9. The EDR API SWG will follow wherever possible the approach of the first modern API standard from OGC, the "OGC API - Features" at https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features and https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html but bearing in mind we are not dealing with pre-defined features with identifiers.

10. The EDR API SWG is also obliged by OGC Policy to be compatible with the "OGC API - Common" emerging standard at https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common wherever possiblre, and to liaise with the appropriate Standards Working Groups and document incompatible essential differences, for future work.
