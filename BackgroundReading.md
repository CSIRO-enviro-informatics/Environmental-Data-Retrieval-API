1. Early work on the Environmental Data Retrieval API was done by the Met Ocean Domain Working Group, who used the name Weather on the Web (wotW). They have drafted an Engineering Rport to summarise the experiences and recommendations. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER 

2. The Met Ocean Domain Working Group will produce an OGC Best Practice document to give guidance to implementers of services in a meteorological context. This will be in a new OGC GitHub repository.

3. There are some simple use cases or scenarios at https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/tree/master/use-cases 

4. There is some more background material in the Weather on the Web repo at https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web . The README.md file is a good place to start. SOmeo fo the challenges are at https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER/blob/master/7-challenges.adoc

5. The minutes of this group should highlight the decisions that have been made. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/Environmental-Data-Retrieval-API/wiki
